# Salesforce Commerce Node.js SDK

[![CircleCI][circleci-image]][circleci-url]

## What is This?

A monorepo containing packages that generate the Salesforce Commerce SDK. Read more about the SDK [here](./packages/generator/README.md).

Visit the [Commerce Cloud Developer Center](https://developer.commercecloud.com/) to learn more about Salesforce Commerce. The developer center has API documentation, getting started guides, community forums, and more.

## Packages

> **Note**: This repository formerly contained @commerce-apps/exchange-connector. That package has been deprecated, and its functionality has been moved to [@commerce-apps/raml-toolkit](https://npmjs.com/package/@commerce-apps/raml-toolkit).

### commerce-sdk

The generator package is responsible for generating the SDK from RAML files. Since the SDK is generated it is not a part of any repository. Read more about the SDK [here](./packages/generator/README.md) and how the generator works [here](./packages/generator/docs/GENERATOR.md).

### @commerce-apps/core

The Core package represents the core functions that call the APIs and interact with Salesforce Commerce. It is used by the SDK. Read more about the core package [here](./packages/generator/README.md).

## Setup

All of these commands can be run from either the repo root or the package root.

```bash
# To setup
npm install

# To build
npm run build
```

## Running Tests

> **Note:** Instructions in the Setup section are prerequisites for this section

To run tests in all the packages, execute

```bash
npm test
```

To print the detailed test results and errors on the console, execute

```bash
npm run test:debug
```

To run tests in the core package only, execute

```bash
npm run test:core
```

To run tests in the generator package only, execute

```bash
npm run test:generator
```

These commands will fail if a minimum of 80% coverage is not maintained per source file. Certain files may show 0% coverage in the report when the file does not include testable statements (i.e. files that only contain an interface). These files will not trigger a failure. The coverage is generated using [nyc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nyc). The configuration is stored within the package.json of each package.
