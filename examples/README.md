# Commerce SDK Examples

This directory contains example usage of the Commerce SDK. Each example contains valid credentials for a public demo instance. Examples 01-03 can be executed successfully as-is (or you can edit them to provide your own credentials). Examples 04-06 require additional editing (marked by EDIT HERE).

> **WARNING:** When creating your own code, _do not_ store secrets as plaintext. Store secrets in a secure location.
