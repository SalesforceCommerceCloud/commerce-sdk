If a `custom qualifers'` or a `assignment qualifiers'` value is set to `null`, it's deleted from existing shopper context. If `effectiveDateTime` or `sourceCode` value is set to an empty string (""), it's deleted from existing shopper context. If `effectiveDateTime` or `sourceCode` value is set to `null`, it's ignored. If an `effectiveDateTime` or `sourceCode` or `custom/assignment qualifiiers'` value is new, it's added to the existing Shopper context. If `customerGroupIds` is set to empty array `[]` the existing value in shopper context is deleted.
