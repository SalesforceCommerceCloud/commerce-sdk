properties:
  type:
    description: | 
      A URI reference [RFC3986] that identifies the
      problem type.  This specification encourages that, when
      dereferenced, it provide human-readable documentation for the
      problem type (e.g., using HTML [W3C.REC-html5-20141028]).  When
      this member is not present, its value is assumed to be
      "about:blank". It accepts relative URIs; this means
      that they must be resolved relative to the document's base URI, as
      per [RFC3986], Section 5.
    type: string
    required: true
    example: https://example.com/probs/out-of-credit

      A URI reference that identifies the specific
      occurrence of the problem.  It may or may not yield further
      information if dereferenced.  It accepts relative URIs; this means

      per [RFC3986], Section 5.
