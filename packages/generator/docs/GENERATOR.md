# Generator

> **Note:** This readme is here to allow a spot for the commerce-sdk readme to be in the root of the package.

* Templates are rendered into the tmpDir specified by [build-config.json](../build-config.json)
* Once rendered they are transpiled to the dist directory just like every other package



## Dependencies 

Dependencies here are used for 2 different things, generation and the sdk itself.  This is an important distinction devDependencies are not distributed.

  * All devDependencies are used for the code generation only
  * All dependencies are used for the commerce-sdk itself
