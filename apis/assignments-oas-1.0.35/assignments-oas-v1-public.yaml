  description: "# API Overview\n\nUse the Assignments API to search for promotions associated with campaigns.\n\nFor more information, see [Campaigns and Promotions](https://documentation.b2c.commercecloud.salesforce.com/DOC1/topic/com.demandware.dochelp/Promotions/CampaignsandPromotions.html) in the Salesforce B2C Commerce Infocenter.\n\n## Authentication & Authorization\n\nThe client requesting the promotion information must have access to the Promotion resource. For resource access, you must use a client ID and client secret from Account Manager to request an access token. The access token is used as a bearer token and added to the Authorization header of your API request. The client must first authenticate against Account Manager to log in.\n\nYou must include the relevant scope(s) in the client ID used to generate the token. For details, see [Authorization Scopes Catalog.](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/commerce-api/guide/auth-z-scope-catalog.html)\n\nFor detailed setup instructions, see [Authorization for Admin APIs](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/commerce-api/guide/authorization-for-admin-apis.html).\n\n## Use Cases\n\n### Find All Associated Promotions\n\nUse the Assignments API to find all associated promotions for a given campaign.

      summary: Search for promotion campaign assignments.
      description: "The promotion campaign assignment search document contains a search object that allows filtering on various attributes.\n\nThe query attribute specifies a complex query that can be used to narrow down the search. Attributes are grouped into different buckets.\n\nThe following is a list of searchable attributes with their corresponding buckets:\n  \n  main:\n  \n  | Attribute | Type |\n  |-----------|--------|\n  | rank| Integer |\n  | startDate | Date |\n  | endDate | Date |\n  \n  campaign:\n  \n  | Attribute | Type |\n  |-----------|--------|\n  | campaign| String |\n  \n  promotion:\n  \n  | Attribute | Type |\n  |-----------|--------|\n  | promotionId| String |\n  | description | String |\n  | enabled | Boolean |\n  \n  special handling:\n  \n  | Attribute | Type |\n  |-----------|--------|\n  | couponId| String |\n\nOnly fields in the same bucket can be joined using a disjunction (or). For instance, when joining campaignId and rank, only a conjunction (and) is allowed, while promotionId and description can be joined using a disjunction because they are in the same bucket. Special handling fields must always use conjunctions. If the field is used in a disjunction that violates this rule, an exception is thrown.\n\n\nNote that only searchable attributes can be used in sorting.\n"

    Range2Filter:
      description: |-
        Allows you to restrict a search result to hits where a range defined by specified attributes has a certain relationship to a specified range.

        The first range (R1) is defined by a pair of attributes (`fromField` and `toField`) that specify the extent of a range, such as attributes `validFrom` and `validTo`.

        The second range (R2) is defined by `fromValue` and `toValue`.

        The filter mode specifies the method used to compare the two ranges:

        * `overlap`: R1 overlaps fully or partially with R2.
        * `containing`: R1 contains R2.
        * `contained`: R1 is contained in R2.

        The range filter supports several value types, and relies on the natural sorting of the value type for range interpretation. Value ranges can be open-ended, but only at one end of the range. You can configure whether the lower bounds and upper bounds are inclusive or exclusive.

        A range 2 filter is useful for general restrictions that can be shared between searches (like a static date range) because the filter result is cached in memory. Range filters are not appropriate if the range is expected to be different for every query (for example, if the user controls the date range down to the hour via a UI control). Range filters are inclusive by default.
      example:
        fromField: validFrom
        toField: validTo
        filterMode: overlap
        fromValue: '2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z'

    TermQuery:
      description: |-
        A term query matches one or more values against one or more document fields. A document is considered a hit if one of the values matches exactly with at least one of the given fields. The operator `is` can only take one value, while `one_of` can take multiple values. If multiple fields are specified, they are combined using a logical `OR` operator.

        **Limitations:**

        * The `greater` and `less` operators are not supported under certain conditions. Both operators are permitted unless the API documentation states otherwise.
        * A subset of Commerce APIs handle queries with multiple fields differently. If the query has multiple fields, the query is internally handled as a logical `OR` of `DisjointMaxQueries` (with the dismax matching a value against all fields). The dismax makes sure that a document carrying a single term in multiple fields does not get higher scores than a document matching multiple terms in multiple fields.
