## Resources

A Salesforce B2C Commerce storefront implementation uses a Catalog, Category, and Product architecture to organize your storefront. Product data is stored in a catalog, and the stored product data is organized by categories. You can create any number of catalog, category, and product scenarios to address your business needs.

### Catalogs

A catalog is a collection of categories, products, and images. Itâ€™s best practice to create two catalogs: the master catalog and the storefront catalog. The master catalog provides the same structure as an external system of record for your products. The storefront catalog is where you create categories that appear on your storefront.

### Categories

You create and organize categories and subcategories to organize and group products in your catalog and on your storefront. Categories allow Products to be organized into hierarchical structures. Categories can have relationships to other parent categories. Each category also can provide a context that is inherited by subcategories, for example a category may have an attribute value assigned to it and any product assigned to the category or a subcategory would inherit the attribute value as long as the product is assigned. Once the product is removed from the category those attribute values would no longer be in the context of the product.

### Products

Products are the items and services for sale on the storefront. All of your product data is stored in your master catalog. For a product or service to show on your storefront, it must be assigned to a category.
