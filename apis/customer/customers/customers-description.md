# API Overview

The Customers API enables you to search for and manage customer information within a customer list. It also enables you to search for customer groups.

Once you find the customer, you can also use the API to manage customer addresses. 

The `customerNo` is created when you create a shopper record. You can create a shopper record using the Customers API or Business Manager. For details, see [registerCustomer](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/commerce-api/references/shopper-customers?meta=registerCustomer) and [Create and Manage Customer Records](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/guide/b2c-customer-records.html?q=create%20customer).
