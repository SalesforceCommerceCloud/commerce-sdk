**DEPRECATION NOTICE**

To enhance the security and availability of Salesforce services, the `/customers/actions/login` and `/trusted-system/actions/login` endpoints are now _**deprecated**_, and _**we plan to remove them in mid-2022**_. These endpoints are not available to new customers, and we discourage existing customers from using them. Instead, we strongly recommend using the endpoints of the [Shopper Login and API Access Service](https://developer.commercecloud.com/s/api-details/a003k00000VWfNDAA1/commerce-cloud-developer-centershopperloginandapiaccessservice) (SLAS) because they meet our rigorous standards for security and availability. All other Shopper Customer endpoints are still recommended for use.

Lets customers register, get authorization tokens, reset passwords, add/delete payment instruments, set up a wish list, add, delete, or modify addresses, and so on.
