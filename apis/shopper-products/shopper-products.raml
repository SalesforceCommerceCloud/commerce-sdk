  Category:
    description: Categories allow products to be organized into hierarchical structures. Categories can have relationships to other parent categories. Each category can also provide a context inherited by subcategories. For example, a category may have an attribute value assigned to it, and any product assigned to the category or a subcategory would inherit the attribute value as long as the product is assigned. Once the product is removed from the category those attribute values would no longer be in the context of the product. Linking of categories is also used for Site hierarchical navigation. For example, inside 'Clothing' you may have 'Mens', and inside 'Mens' you may have 'Pants'. Categories are not *Tags.*
