#%RAML 1.0 Library

#  To be applied on endpoints that use offset and limit pagination controls as described in [pagination controls](https://confluence.internal.salesforce.com/display/ENG/RESTful+APIs+Conventions+and+Standards+v1.1).
#
#  These are available separately as data types as they are sometimes referenced in the body of requests. In that case, it is recommended to override the maximum and the description of the limit to display the actual maximum allowed, possibly with a parameter as done in the offset-paginated trait. 

types:
  offset: 
    description: Used to retrieve the results based on a particular resource offset.
    type: integer
    default: 0
    minimum: 0
  limit: 
    description: Maximum records to retrieve per request, not to exceed the maximum defined. A limit must be at least 1 so at least one record is returned (if any match the criteria).
    type: integer
    default: 10
    minimum: 1
