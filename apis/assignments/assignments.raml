      Searches for promotion campaign assignments.
      
      The promotioncampaignassignment search document contains a search object that allows filtering on various attributes.
      
      The query attribute specifies a complex query that can be used to narrow down the search. attributes are grouped\n into different buckets.  these are the list of searchable attributes with their corresponding buckets:
        
         main:
           
                rank - integer
                startDate - date
                endDate - date
                          
                campaign:
                  
                  campaignId - string
                  
                promotion:
                    
                  promotionId - string
                  description - string
                  enabled - boolean
                  
                special handling:
                  
                couponId - string
                
                
                Only fields in the same bucket can be joined using a disjunction (or). For instance, when joining campaignId and rank above, only a conjunction is allowed (and), whereas promotionId and description can be joined to each other using an 'or' because they are in the same bucket. Special handling fields must always use\n conjunctions. If the field is used in a  disjunction (or) that violates this rule, and an exception is thrown.
                
                Expands that can be applied for the search request:
                
                promotion
                campaign
               
               Note that only searchable attributes (excluding the ones marked with above with an asterisk) can be used in sorting.
